Ambient Ai | A Leader in Physical Security

Ambient Ai is a security platform that specializes in incorporating computer vision intelligence with existing security cameras to reduce false alarms and detect security threats in real time to enable a faster response time and to prevent human casualties.

* Who are the founders of the company? In 2017, co-founders CEO Shikhar Shrestha and CTO Vikesh Khanna founded Ambient Ai. Prior to that, they worked at companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Dropbox. [1]

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? Co-founder Shikar Shrestha and his mother experienced a robbery at gunpoint when he was a pre-teen at a place that was being monitored by security cameras but help never arrived. In that moment he realized that having security cameras was not enough to provide real time intervention.  

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? To date, the company has received $72 million through several investors such as CLF Partners, 515 Ventures, Ali Rowghani, and the most recent Allegion Ventures which funded the company with $20 million in October 2023. Ambient Ai CEO and co-founder Shikhar Shrestha stated: “As we kickstart this transformative partnership with Allegion, we’re propelled by our vision of a powerful AI platform, built on seamless integrations with leading security technologies. Allegion’s best-in-class products bring exciting possibilities to the table as we continue to deliver compelling solutions to prevent even the most complex security incidents.” [2]

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve? To detect and proactively prevent security threats and incidents, and produce faster investigations in minutes, with a focus on privacy concerns as they do not use facial recognition software.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Their intended customers extend across many industries, including but not limited to tech, energy, manufacturing, telecom, aerospace, educational and financial institutions.

* Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? According to Allied Market Research, the global physical security market was valued at USD 104.6 billion in 2020, projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5% from 2021 to 2030. According to Grand View Research, they valued the market size at USD 127.01 in 2020 with a (CAGR) of 6.8% from 2023 to 2090. As for the latest market size per Market.us, they valued it at USD 143.5 billion in 2023 with a projected CAGR of 7.9% from 2023 to 2032 and reaching USD 278.1 billion by 2032. [3] [4] [5] 

* What solution does this company offer that its competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) Unlike similar companies that leverage facial recognition software, Ambient Ai technology focuses on objects and activity detection instead.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? They leverage a combination of deep learning, computer vision intelligence, and graph technology. These combined technologies are used for scene analysis and enhanced understanding.

## Landscape

* What field is the company in? Physical security

* What have been the major trends and innovations in this field over the last 5-10 years? Focusing on automation and analytics while integrating with existing security cameras, infrastructure, and systems with an increased focus on privacy concerns.

* What are the other major companies in this field? ZeroEyes and Scylla. These companies focus on leveraging AI to detect and prevent threats. 

## Results

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? Incident response time, false alarm rate, surveillance coverage, and security officer response time. 
  
* How is your company performing based on these metrics? Ambient Ai has successfully identified over 13.5 million incident alerts that allowed security officials to respond 10 times faster, reduced false alarms by 93%, and sped investigations by 90%. [6]
  
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field? Ambient.Ai and ZeroEyes leverage computer vision intelligence by incorporating their technology into existing security cameras. The biggest difference between these two companies is that Ambient Ai analyzes context, locations, and behavior to identify any security threats while ZeroEyes mainly focuses on gun detection. As for Scylla, they use facial recognition technology, unlike Ambient Ai, and because of that Scylla's customer base is larger than Ambient Ai. Some industries they serve are airports, casinos, sports venues, healthcare facilities, schools, and retail stores. [7] [8]

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? Although Ambient Ai has an expansive library that contains threat signatures, offering the option to modify and adjust threat signatures based on companies' unique security needs could improve accuracy and reduce false security alerts.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? Ambient Ai could have even higher retention rates and better customer satisfaction.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? It would use computer vision technology that focuses on building larger and more diverse datasets. Ambient Ai could also collaborate globally with similar physical security companies to share their existing libraries and build a massive threats signature library broken into different segments and industries. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? These technologies and resources already exist for Ambient Ai. An expanded library would further enhance existing capabilities and service offerings to the customer.
