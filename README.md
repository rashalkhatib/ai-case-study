Ambient AI | A case study | 2024 
 
Ambient AI is a security platform that specializes in incorporating computer vison intelligence with existing security cameras to reduce false alarms and detect security threats in real-time to enable a faster response time to prevent human casualties. 
 
It was founded in 2017 by Co-founders CEO Shikhar Shrestha and CTO Vikesh Khanna.  
 
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? Co-founder Shikar Shretha and his mother experienced a robbery at gunpoint when he was a pre-teen at a place that was monitored by security cameras but help never arrived. He realized that having security cameras was not enough to provide real-time intervention. 
 
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? To date they have funded 72 million through investors such as Allegion Ventures. 
 
## Business Activities 
 
* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve? To detect and proactively prevent security threats and incidents, as well as produce faster investigations in minutes. 
 
* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? According to Grand View Research, the global market was valued at USD 127 billion in 2022, projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 6.8% between 2023 and 2030. 
 
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) Unlike similar companies that leverage facial recognition software, Ambient Ai avoids privacy concerns by focusing on object and activity detection instead. 
 
 
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) 
They leverage a combination of deep learning, computer vision intelligence, and graph technology. These combined technologies are used for scene analysis and enhanced understanding.   
## Landscape 
 
* What field is the company in? Physical security 
 
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5-10 years? 
Focusing on automation and analytics while integrating with existing security cameras, infrastructure, and systems with an increased focus on privacy concerns. 

* What are the other major companies in this field? Senstar, Honeywell Security, Axis Communications, and Rhombas. 
 
## Results 
 
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? Incident response time, false alarm rate, surveillance coverage, and security officer response time. 

 * How is your company performing based on these metrics? Successfully identified over 13.5 million incident alerts that allowed security officials to respond 10 times faster. Also, reduced false alarms by 93%.  
 
## Recommendations 
 
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!) 
 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? 
 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? 
 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
